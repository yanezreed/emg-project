## Project Requirements

As mentioned this application has been developed for Guitar Anatomy.
Details on which can be found here https://guitaranatomy.com/.

Discussed and agreed on application objectives:

- A suitable, understandable workflow/process for new employees
- Reduces time spent reading/writing customer messages
- Negate dependency on eBay's messaging portal
- Consistent welcoming tone displayed in generated responses
- Customer issues/complaints dealt with professionally
- The interface is designed to be minimal and clean
- Focusing on functionality over aesthetics
- Overall improvement of reliability and reduction in manual actions

Throughout this development process, I will be constantly working alongside the co-owner, gathering feedback on prototypes tested by the current employees. Assessment on all of the ui layout, ai response reliability, tone and general navigation will be done.

Having committed to implementing modular design in my code, I expect to be able to quickly address the relevant issues raised for any specific components.

## Problem Statement

Due to the demands and intricacies of selling instrument parts online, a lot of the communication between customers and users involves repetitively answering recurring questions on item compatibility, availability, postage insurance, and delivery changes. For staff to be able to accurately respond to each conversation, they manually check the message history of the customer, search for item specifics, and craft this all in a consistent, professional, welcoming tone.

Being hyper-repetitive and having to traverse different programs and chrome tabs, this manual process is extremely prone to inconsistency. Leading to errors in replies and slower response times.

Introducing automation, I believe, could streamline the repetitive aspects of customer support at this level. Generating quality responses could allow staff to focus their time on selective complex inquiries, avoid errors forced by cumulative repetitive responses, and promote consistency by reducing workload induced stress.

So the absolute goal of this project is to automate only the repetitive elements of the customer support process, not to replace human supervision. Not replacing human judgment, but supporting it. As the business will still rely on staff's ability to assess responses, editing where is needed, to safeguard the quality and tone of customer relations.

## Objectives

# Core Features:

- Deliver a functional desktop application interface built with a combination of python and pyside6.

- Create a secure api system for grabbing and receiving ebay conversations using the documentation recommended, OAuth authentication to gain access.

- Provide reply options/actions to users within the messenger interface; edit, copy, paste, send and retry.

- Colour coordinated conversation markers, to display status.

- Log in/out system to ensure only authorised staff usage.

​

# Quality & Technical Goals:

- Create a clean, uncluttered user interface to ensure ease of use.

- Ensure modular, maintainable code following the software principles I have learnt.

- Create clear documentation consistent documentation at all stages of the project.

- Note feedback from business within the daily log, as well as alterations to design.
