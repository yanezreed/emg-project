# EMG-Project

## Project Overview

This project is a native desktop application used as an internal tool for the staff at Guitar Anatomy, an eBay based ecommerce company based in the North East of England. Whom specialise in selling specialized guitar parts.

The application itself is designed to assist staff manage the ever increasing inquiries received through eBay’s platform messaging system. With the primary goal of reducing response times, improving consistency, accuracy and to generalize a tone across all customer communications.

Initially aiming to create a full automated program, because of the use of AI within my project, the design required a pivot. Constraints on the use of customer data, imposed through the eBay Developer Program License Agreement and the data protection act, lead me to develop an application with two optional workflows. Each contains different levels of AI involvement, but both alike by the fact data is never stored, persisted or used to train AI models.

Lastly this is a project built as a portfolio piece and is in no way affiliated with eBay.
