# EMG-Project

## Project Overview

This desktop application has been developed for internal use at Guitar Anatomy, an eBay based ecommerce business situated in the north of England. Designed with the goal of assisting staff in their response to customer queries within eBay's platform messaging system.

To ensure full compliance with eBay’s Developer Program License Agreement and data protection requirements, this application has two optional workflows, differing in their use of AI during the reply process.

The first workflow utilizes eBay’s on platform AI, which is permitted to process sensitive customer data held on the platform. This generated reply is then reviewed and enriched using the local AI model, preloaded with business centric information.

The second workflow, avoids any contact with sensitive customer data, relying solely on a local, prompt driven AI model again pre loaded with business information. Acting purely as a support tool for staff members through the reply process, granting instant access to internal knowledge and commonly asked questions.

Due to strict data handling limitations imposed by the platform, neither workflow can possibly be fully automated. Instead, both are intentionally designed as assistive tools rather than full replacements for human decision making. The aim of each workflow is to improve consistency, tone, and efficiency of customer responses, while enforcing manual review at each processing stage. As it is through human involvement that this application is allowed to benefit from AI assistance, while remaining fully compliant with legal and platform requirements set by eBay.

This two solution approach has also been implemented to ensure that the application will remain usable in the event of future changes to eBay’s policies, providing flexibility to the business in which workflow suits the current environment.
