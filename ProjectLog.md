### Personal Project Log

Through this document, i will be recording my daily progress on this project.
As someone new to development, i will be expecting to go back and forth on various decisions and problem-solving approaches.

With my goal being to provide insight into my thought process, so that even when making errors, i can will be able to clearly communicate
where I'm coming from, what i've learnt, and any revelations i encounter.

## 2025-11-21 – Repository Setup & Development Plan

Today i started my active development of my project after spending the last couple of weeks reasearching the tools and technologies needed for this project.

My first goal was to set up a clean a profecional repository strutcure along with creating an inital deleopment plan.

Today i started my active development of my project after a couple of weeks

After a few weeks of researching/learning new technologies, i’m now beginning active development by laying down the project foundation.
Aiming to update my github repo with a clean, professional structure, and with a initial development plan in my "initial-project-plan.md" file.
Where i will be outlining potential risks related to data management, technical decisions, tech stack and my personal deadlines.

Notes:

- Had some trouble pushing content to git-repo, ".venv" overflowing 100mb per file limit.

* After having several blocked pushes in a row, i found the issue was my ".gitignore" file wasnt blocking ".venv" from being pushed.
* To solved this i incorperated the officiaal python template, link below.
* Lastly i added a "requirments.txt" file along with "pip freeze > requirements.txt.
